# Big Datadventure
Well, yes... this was a huge adventure. Once, in the plethora of tutorials and blogs I read, I came across this [Infographic](https://toggl.com/blog/seven-levels-developer-hell) with the seven circles of developer hell and I can relate. The project is delivered as a result of the course "Big Data Programming", taught by Bernhard Ortner at the DHBW Stuttgart. Goal of this ReadMe document is to give a brief overview of the most important information relating to solving **Task 2: Helm und Kubernetes Microservice**.
